All CSV files should be separated with ;

players (for auto-generate teams and single)
First_name;Last_name;sex(m/f);Average(for example 180.5);HDCP(if there is no HDCP then put 0)

players in ready teams
First_name_of_player1;Last_name_of_player1;sex_of_player1(m/f);Average_of_player1(for example 180.5);HDCP_of_player1(if there is no HDCP then put 0);First_name_of_player2;Last_name_of_player2;sex_of_player2(m/f);Average_of_player2(for example 180.5);HDCP_of_player2(if there is no HDCP then put 0); (same for the rest of the players)
(if a team has less players then they are inserted as blind then: BLIND;BLIND;;0;0)

pins
pins(max limit);points
(example: for 0-100 pins -> 1 point
for 101-200 pins -> 2 points
then it will be written like:
